Question to ask : 

- What are the exact requirements in term of code (MVT for python, design patterns, etc.) ?
- The mini project seems to be added to the pdf file, is there things to add or is it the mini project as it is to this day ?
- Do you have recommandations about the code structure for the city traffic project ? 


For the finale file : 

- DL 8 janvier 20h
- 1 pdf / student (name should be in this format : SE-30432-SurnameFirstname.pdf)
- No natural language explanation asked (mandatory to not put natural language explanations)
- In it should appears : diagrams (UML, Prism, etc.), in appendix (source code of the project + source code of the mini project)
- In each student file should appears CLEARLY what the student developped personnaly and he can put others code but his code should be clearly visible.
- Here are the explanations from the professor :

3) Final report (final project documentation) content and recommended
structure:

Title, Author, Abstract, Team (all team members, including the author of
the report)
A. Final project:
- Design: all relevant design models (semi-formal models, e.g., UML
diagrams,
and/or formal models, e.g., PRISM models, Session Types protocols, etc);
projects which use UML as a modeling language should include at least
the following diagrams: use case diagram, class diagram, and deployment
diagram
B. Final project
- implementation (source code)
- Appendix: Mini project (code source only)
C. References

If necessary, the author can extend the above structure with
descriptions of:
- experimental results, test cases, etc.;
- other design, performance, implementation or verification
models and components (not mentioned above)

Remark: The final project should be reasonably self contained. It should
include
only design and implementation models and components developed by the
author of the project.
It is also permitted to include models and/or code developed by the
other members of your team.

Remark: You should not include material (descriptions of design,
implementation or verification aspects)
developed by other authors (which are not members of your development
team).
You should clearly cite all external sources in the References section.
Students who develop the SE project under my supervision
need NOT prepare a Power Point presentation
